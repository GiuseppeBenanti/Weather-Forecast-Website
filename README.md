# Weather-Forecast-Website
Weather Forecast Website using JSON files to display detailed weather information.
Download all files and put them in the same folder. You can run the html file directly in your Browser, but to use the links (linked to JSON files) you will need to open the Website folder in the open source "Brackets" software environment. Inside Brackets, set the Website folder as the working folder for Brackets, then run the html file from inside the software (using 'Live Preview', the bolt icon top right corner of Brackets GUI-Graphical User Interface).
